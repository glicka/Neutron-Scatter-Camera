# QT5.1 SIS 3302/3320 Parsers 

Requirements:
- HDF5 library installation. Make sure you install the cxx (c++) tools with the installation. http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html
- Visual Studio 2012 Express. http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/downloads
- QT5.1.1 (or higher?). http://qt-project.org/downloads

##  Windows Source Code

This code is configured for 64bit Windows machines specifically. You need to make sure the hdf5 libraries are in the same location on your machine as in the *.pro file for the compiler to identify the HDF5 libraries.

## Linux Source Code

The windows or osx source code should be fine for compiling on a Linux machine. Confirm that the HDF5 libraries are in the correct install location.
